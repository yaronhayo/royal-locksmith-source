## Why Lock Maintenance Matters

Like any mechanical device, locks need occasional care to function properly. Regular maintenance prevents:
- Stuck or jammed locks
- Key breakage inside the lock
- Premature lock failure
- Expensive emergency locksmith calls

The best part? Most maintenance takes just minutes and requires minimal tools.

## Essential Lock Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Lubricate Annually

Locks need lubrication to prevent internal parts from binding. Use **graphite powder** or **Teflon-based lubricant**—never WD-40 for locks.

**How to lubricate:**
1. Spray a small amount into the keyhole
2. Insert and remove the key several times
3. Wipe off any excess around the keyhole
4. Test the lock several times

**When to do it:** Once a year, or if the key becomes hard to turn.

### 2. Clean Your Keys

Dirty keys transfer debris into the lock mechanism. Occasionally clean keys with:
- Rubbing alcohol on a cloth
- Mild soap and water
- Check for bent or worn keys (replace if damaged)

### 3. Check Strike Plate Alignment

Over time, doors settle and the strike plate may not align with the latch.

**Signs of misalignment:**
- Door doesn't latch properly
- You have to lift or push the door to lock
- Lock is hard to turn

**Fix:** Loosen strike plate screws, adjust position, re-tighten. May need to enlarge the hole.

### 4. Tighten Loose Hardware

Door handles and locks can loosen with use. Check every few months:
- Tighten deadbolt screws
- Tighten handle/lever screws
- Check hinges for looseness

### 5. Inspect Weatherstripping

Weather affects locks. In Northern New Jersey winters:
- Check for ice buildup (thaw with warm water, not hot)
- Ensure weatherstripping doesn't create excess friction
- Apply lubricant before cold seasons

## Maintenance by Lock Type

### Deadbolts
- Lubricate every 6-12 months
- Check alignment annually
- Replace if turn becomes difficult

### Door Handles/Knobs
- Tighten set screws if loose
- Lubricate latch mechanism
- Clean with mild soap (avoid harsh chemicals)

### Smart Locks
- Replace batteries proactively (before warnings)
- Update firmware when available
- Clean fingerprint sensors with microfiber cloth
- Check battery contacts for corrosion

### Padlocks
- Especially important for outdoor padlocks
- Lubricate shackle and keyway
- Store indoors when possible to prevent rust

### Car Locks
- Keep key fob batteries fresh
- Lubricate mechanical key backup
- Don't force frozen locks (use de-icer)

## When to Call a Professional

Maintenance can't fix everything. Call a locksmith if:
- Key is stuck inside the lock
- Lock no longer turns at all
- Visible damage to the lock body
- Security upgrade is needed
- Rekeying is required (new home, lost keys)

## DIY Maintenance Kit

Keep these on hand:
- Graphite lubricant or Teflon spray
- Small screwdriver set
- Microfiber cloths
- Rubbing alcohol
- Spare batteries for smart locks

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Lubricate locks | Annually |
| Clean keys | Every few months |
| Check alignment | Annually |
| Tighten hardware | Every 6 months |
| Smart lock batteries | Before low warning |
| Professional inspection | Every 2-3 years |

## One Pro Tip

**Never force a stubborn lock.** If a key is hard to turn, forcing it risks breaking the key inside. Lubricate first, and if that doesn't work, call a professional before you're locked out.
