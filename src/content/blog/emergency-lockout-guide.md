## Don't Panic: Your First Steps After a Lockout

Being locked out is one of those frustrating situations that can happen to anyone. Whether it's your home, car, or office, the key is to stay calm and take methodical steps to resolve the situation safely.

### Immediate Actions

**1. Verify You're Actually Locked Out**
Before calling for help, double-check all entry points. Check other doors, garage entries, and windows you may have left accessible. You'd be surprised how often people have an unlocked back door they forgot about.

**2. Check for Spare Keys**
Do you have a spare with a neighbor, family member, or hidden somewhere safe? Many lockouts are resolved this simply.

**3. Ensure Your Safety**
If it's late at night, a dangerous neighborhood, or extreme weather, prioritize finding a safe place to wait. A nearby business, friend's house, or your vehicle (if you have access) works well.

### When to Call a Professional Locksmith

Call a locksmith if:
- You've exhausted all easy options
- You're in an unsafe situation
- Attempting entry yourself could cause damage
- It's a smart lock or high-security system

### How to Choose a Reliable Locksmith

**Verify Credentials**
Always ask for license number, insurance, and ID upon arrival. In New Jersey, legitimate locksmiths carry proper licensing.

**Get an Estimate First**
A reputable locksmith provides a clear estimate before starting work. Be wary of anyone who won't quote a price.

**Local Matters**
Choose a local company with a physical address and established reputation. They're accountable to your community.

### Prevention Tips

- Hide spare keys with trusted neighbors, not under doormats
- Consider a smart lock with keypad or phone access
- Develop a routine: keys in the same place every time
- For vehicles, keep a spare key in your wallet or with a family member

### What About DIY Lock Picking?

We advise against attempting to pick your own locks. Without proper training:
- You may damage the lock, making professional repair more expensive
- You could trigger alarm systems
- Neighbors might call police, creating an awkward situation

Trust professionals who can get you in quickly and safely without damage.
