## The Locksmith Industry Has a Problem

Unfortunately, the locksmith industry has been plagued by scammers who prey on people in vulnerable situations. These "locksmiths" typically appear in online searches, quote low prices, then charge outrageous fees once they arrive.

Here's how to protect yourself.

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Before They Arrive
- **Generic phone answers**: "Locksmith services" instead of a company name
- **No physical address**: Legitimate companies have a shop or office
- **Extremely low quotes**: $15-35 for a lockout is too good to be true
- **Refusing to give estimates**: Quotes should be clear before dispatch

### When They Arrive
- **Unmarked vehicle**: Professionals have branded service vehicles
- **No uniform or ID**: Ask for identification and license
- **Cash only**: Legitimate businesses accept credit cards
- **Price inflation**: Final price significantly exceeds quote
- **Drilling first**: Good locksmiths pick locks; drilling is a last resort

## How to Find a Trustworthy Locksmith

### 1. Research Before You Need One
Save a locksmith's number before an emergency. You'll make better decisions when not stressed.

### 2. Verify Credentials
In New Jersey, locksmiths must be licensed. Ask for the license number and verify at the state's licensing website.

### 3. Check Reviews Carefully
- Look for detailed reviews mentioning specific services
- Beware of companies with only 5-star reviews (could be fake)
- Check multiple platforms: Google, Yelp, BBB

### 4. Get a Full Quote
Ask for the complete price including:
- Service call fee
- Labor costs
- Parts/materials
- Any after-hours fees

A reputable locksmith provides this upfront.

### 5. Look for Local Presence
- Physical storefront or office
- Years in the community
- Recognizable branding
- Local phone number (not 800 number)

## Questions to Ask a Locksmith

Before they arrive:
1. "What is your company's full name and address?"
2. "What is your license number?"
3. "Can you give me a price range for my situation?"
4. "Are there any additional fees I should know about?"

When they arrive:
1. "May I see your ID and license?"
2. "What is the final price before you start?"
3. "Can you try non-destructive entry first?"

## Common Scam Tactics

### The Low-Ball Quote
Scammer quotes $35 on the phone, charges $350 on-site. They claim "complicated lock" or fabricate issues.

**Protection**: Get a firm quote range before dispatch.

### The Driller
Scammer immediately drills the lock, then says you need a new one—at premium price.

**Protection**: Ask if they'll try picking first. Drilling should be rare.

### The Hostage Situation
Scammer threatens to call police or refuses to leave without payment.

**Protection**: Pay and dispute with credit card later, or call local police.

### The Fake Website
Elaborate website advertising local service, but it's a call center routing to the cheapest contractor.

**Protection**: Call the direct local number, verify address, check reviews.

## What a Good Locksmith Experience Looks Like

1. Clear quote given over the phone
2. Arrival in marked vehicle
3. Technician presents ID and license
4. Confirms price before starting
5. Attempts non-destructive entry
6. Explains the work being done
7. Provides receipt and warranty information
8. Accepts credit card payment
