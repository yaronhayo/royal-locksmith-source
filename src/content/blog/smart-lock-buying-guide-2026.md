## Why Consider a Smart Lock in 2026?

Smart locks have evolved dramatically in recent years. Today's options offer military-grade encryption, seamless smart home integration, and convenience features that make traditional keys feel outdated.

### Key Benefits of Modern Smart Locks

- **Remote access**: Lock and unlock from anywhere via smartphone
- **Guest access**: Create temporary codes for visitors or service providers
- **Activity logs**: Know exactly when doors are accessed
- **Auto-lock features**: Never forget to lock the door again

## What to Look For

### Security Standards
- **ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 or 2**: Ensure the lock meets residential security standards

### Compatibility
- **Smart home ecosystem**: Works with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Alexa?
- **Door thickness**: Most require 1-3/8" to 2" doors

### Power Options

- **Backup options**: Physical key, external battery port
- **Low battery alerts**: Push notifications before lockout

## Installation Considerations

Most smart locks are DIY-friendly, but professional installation ensures:
- Proper alignment for reliable operation

- Integration with existing security systems
- Warranty compliance
