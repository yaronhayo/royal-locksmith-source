faqs:
  - question: "Why should I replace my locks instead of just rekeying them?"
    answer: "Rekeying only changes the key; it doesn't change the security level of the lock itself. If your home has Grade 3 (low quality) locks, they remain vulnerable to being kicked in or bumped regardless of the key. Replacement allows you to upgrade to Grade 1 or 2 hardware, which provides a significantly higher physical barrier against intruders."
  - question: "What is an ANSI/BHMA Grade, and why does it matter?"
    answer: "ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and BHMA (Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association) grade locks on strength and durability. Grade 1 is the highest (commercial strength), Grade 2 is for residential security, and Grade 3 is basic. We recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for all primary home entry points to maximize protection."
  - question: "Can you replace my old locks with smart locks without changing the door?"
    answer: "In 95% of cases, yes. Modern smart locks are designed to fit standard 'bore holes.' If your door is older or has a non-standard prep, our technicians are equipped to modify the cross-bore on-site to ensure a perfect, secure fit for your new technology."
  - question: "How do I know if the replacement lock is 'Bump-Proof'?"
    answer: "Look for locks that utilize 'Anti-Bump' driver pins. These pins are designed to bind or remain stationary during a bump attempt. We primarily install Schlage and Mul-T-Lock cylinders which feature these advanced security measures as standard."
  - question: "Will a new lock stop my door from being kicked in?"
    answer: "A lock is only as strong as its connection to the house frame. During a replacement, we don't just swap the lock; we install reinforced strike plates with 3-inch hardened steel screws that anchored directly into the wall studs, significantly increasing the force required to kick in the door."
