faqs:
  - question: "How can you make a key if I don't have the original?"
    answer: "This is the difference between a high-tech automotive locksmith and a hardware store booth. We use a 'Lishi' tool or a 'Scope' to decode the internal wafers of your door lock. This gives us the 'Bitting Code.' We then cross-reference your VIN with the manufacturer's database to verify the correct electronic transponder profile before cutting and programming a fresh key from scratch."
  - question: "Why does the dealership say it takes 3 days to get a key?"
    answer: "Dealerships often do not have on-site key cutters or EEPROM programmers. They typically order pre-cut keys from a central warehouse based on your VIN. As a mobile automotive specialist, we carry blank 'Smart Keys' for almost every major make (Honda, Toyota, BMW, Ford, etc.) and perform the cutting and programming right next to your car."
  - question: "What is a Transponder Chip, and why is it necessary?"
    answer: "Since the late 1990s, cars have an 'Immobilizer System.' The key head contains a tiny passive RFID chip. When you turn the ignition, the car's computer (ECU) sends a pulse. The chip must respond with a matched encrypted code. If it doesn't, the fuel pump is disabled. We program this specific handshake on-site."
  - question: "Can you make keys for high-end European brands like BMW or Mercedes?"
    answer: "Yes. Unlike many locksmiths, we specialize in European 'CAS' and 'EIS' systems. These require advanced bench-programming (EEPROM) where we read the data directly from the car's security module. This allows us to provide keys for BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and VW at a portion of the dealer's cost."
  - question: "Will my new key also work my remote buttons (Lock/Unlock)?"
    answer: "Absolutely. When we program a 'Remote Head' or 'Smart Fob,' we ensure all functions are synchronized—including proximity entry, push-to-start, trunk release, and panic buttons."
