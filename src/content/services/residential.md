faqs:
  - question: "Is it better to rekey or replace my locks after moving?"
    answer: "If your lock hardware is in good physical condition and of high quality, rekeying is 100% sufficient and more cost-effective. It involves changing the internal pins so old keys won't work. We recommend replacement only if the locks are Grade 3 (low quality) or showing signs of mechanical fatigue."
  - question: "What is a 'Grade 1' lock, and do I need one for my home?"
    answer: "Grade 1 is the highest security rating defined by ANSI/BHMA, typically tested for 1 million cycles and heavy impacts. While most homes use Grade 2, we recommend Grade 1 deadbolts for the primary entry points of North Bergen and Jersey City homes for maximum kick-in resistance."
  - question: "Can you make my front door and garage door use the same key?"
    answer: "Yes, this is called 'Keyed Alike.' As long as the lock brands use the same keyway (e.g., both are Schlage or both are Kwikset), we can rekey them to use a single master key for your convenience."
  - question: "Will a smart lock still work if the Wi-Fi goes down?"
    answer: "Yes. Most smart locks use Bluetooth for local control or have a physical key override. Wi-Fi is primarily for remote access and notifications. You will never be locked out simply because your internet is down."
  - question: "What's the difference between a 'Bumping' and 'Picking'?"
    answer: "Picking is a skilled manipulation of pins; 'Bumping' is a brute-force technique using a special key. We install 'Anti-Bump' cylinders that utilize specialized driver pins to neutralize these common residential burglary methods."
