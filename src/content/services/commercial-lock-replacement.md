faqs:
  - question: "What is an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core) system?"
    answer: "SFIC is a standard in commercial locksmithing where the lock cylinder (the 'core') can be removed using a special 'control key' without taking the entire lock off the door. This allows a facility manager to rekey a door in 3 seconds. We specialize in Best, Falcon, and Arrow SFIC profiles for major NJ office complexes."
  - question: "Why can't I use residential locks on my business doors?"
    answer: "Beyond the obvious security vulnerability, residential locks are not fire-rated for commercial use and do not meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities) requirements for 'unassisted egress.' Furthermore, a residential lock will typically fail within months if subjected to the high-frequency use of a retail storefront."
  - question: "Are your commercial locks fire-rated?"
    answer: "Yes. For stairwell doors and corridor entry points, we exclusively install UL-Listed, 3-hour fire-rated hardware. We ensure that the lock and the strike plate do not compromise the 'Listing' of your fire-rated door assembly, keeping you in compliance with NJ State Fire Marshall requirements."
  - question: "Can you replace locks on aluminum storefront glass doors?"
    answer: "Yes. Storefront doors use a specific 'narrow-stile' mortise lock (typically Adams Rite). These require specialized technical adjustment of the drive-cam and pivoting bolt. We carry all necessary configurations, including electrified versions for remote buzzing-in."
  - question: "How do you handle lock replacement for high-turnover businesses?"
    answer: "For retail and hospitality, we recommend either SFIC systems or cloud-managed electronic locks. These allow you to invalidate previous employee access immediately, reducing the long-term cost of locksmith visits."
