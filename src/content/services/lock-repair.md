faqs:
  - question: "Why is my key suddenly difficult to turn in the lock?"
    answer: "This is usually caused by one of three things: internal debris/grit, an unlubricated cylinder whereby the pins are dragging, or most commonly, a slight misalignment between the door and the frame. As the seasons change in NJ, wood doors expand and contract, causing the lock's bolt to rub against the strike plate. We diagnose and solve the root cause, whether it's mechanical or structural."
  - question: "Can you fix a lock where the handle sags or won't spring back?"
    answer: "Yes. This is typically a failure of the 'torsion spring' inside the lever or knob. While many locksmiths would suggest a full replacement, we carry internal spring-replacement kits for major brands like Schlage and Kwikset, allowing us to repair the mechanism and save you the cost of new hardware."
  - question: "Is it safe to use WD-40 in my locks?"
    answer: "No. WD-40 is a solvent, not a long-term lubricant. It attracts dust and eventually turns into a 'gummy' residue that will seize your pins. We use professional-grade PTFE or graphite spray specifically designed for high-precision mechanical components, ensuring a clean, friction-free operation for years."
  - question: "Can you fix a lock if the key broke off inside it?"
    answer: "Yes. Using surgical-grade extraction tools, we can remove the broken fragment without damaging the internal wafers or pins. In most cases, the lock itself remains perfectly functional once the fragment is removed."
  - question: "Do you repair old-fashioned 'Skeleton Key' or Mortise locks?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in the preservation and repair of historic hardware common in the brownstones of Jersey City and Hoboken. We can often source period-correct internal parts to keep your Victorian-era locks functioning as they did in the 1890s."
