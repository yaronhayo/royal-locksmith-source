faqs:
  - question: "If I rekey my lock, does the old key still work?"
    answer: "No. The rekeying process involves removing the internal pins and replacing them with a new set of varying heights. Once the cylinder is reassembled with the new pins, the old key will no longer align with the shear line, making it physically impossible for the old key to rotate the lock."
  - question: "Is rekeying as secure as getting new locks?"
    answer: "Yes, from an access control perspective. If your existing locks are physically robust (Grade 1 or 2), rekeying is perfectly secure. However, if your locks are old, rusted, or of low quality, replacing them with a higher-grade model would be the better security choice."
  - question: "Can you rekey different brands of locks to the same key?"
    answer: "This is a common question. You can only 'Key Alike' locks that share the same 'Keyway' (the shape of the key hole). For example, you can rekey a Schlage deadbolt and an Emtek handleset to the same key because they both use the 'SC1' keyway. You cannot rekey a Kwikset to a Schlage key without replacing the entire cylinder."
  - question: "How long does it take for a locksmith to rekey a whole house?"
    answer: "A standard 3-bedroom home with 5 or 6 locks typically takes 45 to 90 minutes. This includes removing the cylinders, re-pinning them, cutting the new keys, and testing the operation of every door."
  - question: "What is a 'Master Key' system for a house?"
    answer: "A master key system allows one 'Grand Master' key to open every door, while other keys (like one for a tenant or a cleaning service) only open specific doors. We can design these multi-tier access systems for your home on the spot."
