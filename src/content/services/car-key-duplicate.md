faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between 'Cloning' and 'Programming' a key?"
    answer: "Cloning makes an exact digital 'twin' of your existing key. The car thinks the clone IS the original. Programming involves adding a brand-new ID to a specific slot in your vehicle's computer. Cloning is the faster and safer method for many older cars, while Programming is required for most modern smart-fob systems. We choose the optimal method based on your car's specific security architecture."
  - question: "Can a hardware store duplicate my car key?"
    answer: "Standard hardware stores can only duplicate basic metal keys. They lack the expensive diagnostic computers required to communicate with a car's immobilizer. Even 'Automated Kiosks' often fail to correctly program the chip or handle laser-cut keys. As automotive specialists, we guarantee a 100% functional key with both mechanical and electronic integrity."
  - question: "Is it better to have two different fobs or two 'Clones' of the same fob?"
    answer: "For modern vehicles, having two separate programmed IDs is superior. If one key is lost and later found, we can disable only the lost ID. If you have two clones and lose one, we have to wipe and reset the entire system. We recommend native programming for all vehicles newer than 2015."
  - question: "How long does a car key duplication take on-site?"
    answer: "A standard transponder key takes about 15-20 minutes. A high-security smart fob for a luxury vehicle may take 30-40 minutes as the car's computer often requires a 'timed security delay' before allowing us to enter the programming interface."
  - question: "My original key is worn and sticking. Will a duplicate also stick?"
    answer: "Not if we do it. Instead of tracing your worn key (which would just replicate the damage), we use our 'Optical Decoder' to determine the original factory cuts (the 'bitting'). We then cut a fresh key to the original factory specifications, which often works better than your current worn-out original."
