faqs:
  - question: "How does a master key system improve business security?"
    answer: "A master key system reduces 'key creep.' Instead of employees carrying 10 keys, they carry 1 that only opens their authorized zones. By using restricted keyways, we also prevent unauthorized key duplication at hardware stores, ensuring you have 100% control over who has access."
  - question: "What are the ADA requirements for commercial door hardware in NJ?"
    answer: "According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all commercial door hardware must be operable with one hand and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. This typically means replacing knob locks with lever-style handles. We ensure all your exterior and interior doors meet these federal standards."
  - question: "Can I manage my business access control from my smartphone?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in cloud-based access control systems. You can lock/unlock doors, add or delete employee credentials, and view entry logs in real-time from anywhere in the world using your mobile device."
  - question: "What is a 'Panic Bar' and is it required for my storefront?"
    answer: "A panic bar (or rim exit device) allows for immediate egress during an emergency. In NJ, if your building has a certain occupancy load or is a specific type of business (like a restaurant or school), fire codes mandate these devices. We provide code-compliant installation and testing."
  - question: "Do you offer 'After-Hours' service for commercial emergencies?"
    answer: "Yes. We understand that a broken storefront lock or a failed security gate at 10 PM is a liability. We provide 24/7 priority emergency response for our commercial clients throughout Northern New Jersey."
