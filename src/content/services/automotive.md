faqs:
  - question: "Can a locksmith make a key for a modern car with a chip?"
    answer: "Yes. Unlike hardware stores that can only cut simple metal keys, we carry advanced OBD-II programming computers that can sync encrypted transponder chips with your vehicle's ECU. We can generate high-security keys for 98% of vehicles on the road."
  - question: "Why is the dealership charging so much for a replacement fob?"
    answer: "Dealerships often have high overhead and charge 'premium' rates for programming. They also usually require you to tow the car to them. We bring the 'dealership' to you, cutting out the tow fee and typically saving you 30-50% on the key itself."
  - question: "What is an EEPROM car key service?"
    answer: "Some European vehicles (BMW, VW, Audi) require 'EEPROM' programming, where we safely read the data directly from the car's computer chip rather than the OBD port. We are among the few locksmiths in NJ certified for this advanced level of automotive security."
  - question: "Can you replace a car key if I don't have the original code?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We can pull your key code directly from the vehicle's VIN or by de-coding the physical wafers inside your door lock. You do not need the original dealer code for us to help you."
  - question: "Will a new key automatically disable my lost ones?"
    answer: "In most modern 'Proximity' or 'Push-to-Start' systems, we can perform a 'Key Deletion' during the programming process. This wipes the lost key from the car's memory, ensuring that even if someone finds it, they cannot start your vehicle."
