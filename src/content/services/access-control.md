faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between 'Fail-Safe' and 'Fail-Secure' locks?"
    answer: "This is a critical distinction for fire safety. A 'Fail-Safe' lock (like a Magnetic Lock) releases when power is lost, allowing for immediate exit. A 'Fail-Secure' lock (like an Electric Strike) remains locked from the outside when power is lost but allows a mechanical handle to open the door from the inside. We ensure your system is configured to meet NJ State Fire Codes."
  - question: "Can we use our iPhones or Apple Watches to unlock the office doors?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern systems utilize 'Mobile Credentials' via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communication (NFC). Users can simply tap their phone or even just approach the door with their phone in their pocket to gain access. This eliminates the cost and hassle of physical plastic cards."
  - question: "Can I manage access for three different NJ locations from one portal?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our Cloud-Based platforms (like Brivo or Openpath) are designed for multi-site management. You can manage a warehouse in Secaucus, a retail store in North Bergen, and an office in Jersey City all from a single dashboard, with unified user profiles across all locations."
  - question: "What happens if our internet goes out? Will the doors stop working?"
    answer: "No. Professional access control 'Controllers' have internal memory that stores a copy of the authorized database. If the cloud connection is lost, the doors will continue to operate normally for all existing users. The system will then 'sync' the audit logs to the cloud once the connection is restored."
  - question: "How does biometrics (fingerprint/face) work with employee privacy laws?"
    answer: "Professional biometric readers do not store an 'image' of the finger or face. Instead, they convert the biological measurements into an encrypted mathematical 'template.' This template cannot be used to reconstruct a fingerprint, protecting your employees' privacy while providing unbreakable security."
