faqs:
  - question: "How long does it take for an emergency locksmith to arrive?"
    answer: "In Northern NJ, particularly Hudson and Bergen Counties, our average arrival time is promptly. We use a real-time GPS dispatch system to send the technician physically closest to your location."
  - question: "Will unlocking my car damage the power locks or windows?"
    answer: "No. Unlike amateur 'slim-jim' methods that can pull wires or damage weather-stripping, we use precision air-wedges and long-reach tools that never touch your internal door mechanics."
  - question: "Can a locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock or Medeco?"
    answer: "Most emergency locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians carry specialized picking tools for high-security cylinders. While these take longer than standard locks, we can often bypass them without drilling."
  - question: "What if my key is broken inside the lock?"
    answer: "Don't try to pull it out yourself—you'll likely push it deeper. We use surgical-grade extraction tools to remove the broken blade without replacing the entire cylinder."
  - question: "Do you service lockouts during blizzards or holidays?"
    answer: "Yes. Our mobile fleet is equipped for all weather conditions. We remain fully operational 365 days a year, including holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas."
