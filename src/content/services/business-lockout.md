faqs:
  - question: "How do you verify authorization for a commercial lockout in NJ?"
    answer: "Commercial security requires strict protocol. We verify authorization through a combination of Photo ID and business documentation (e.g., an occupational license, a lease agreement, or being listed as an authorized contact on the building's management directory). For high-security facilities, we often require a verbal confirmation from the business owner or property manager."
  - question: "Can you open a door with a 'Panic Bar' from the outside?"
    answer: "Yes. Most commercial exit devices (Von Duprin, Detex, Jackson) have an external keyed trim. If you've lost the key, we can pick the cylinder or use specialized 'Over-the-Door' tools that interact with the internal panic bar lever, granting access without damaging the fire-rated integrity of the door."
  - question: "What should I do if my electronic key card system has failed?"
    answer: "Electronic failures are often caused by power surges or battery depletion in the backup unit. We provide mechanical overrides for most electronic strikes and magnetic locks. Once inside, we can also assist in diagnosing the power failure to prevent future lockouts."
  - question: "Our storefront has a glass door with an 'Adams Rite' lock. Can you open it?"
    answer: "Storefront glass doors use a specific 'swinging-bolt' or 'deadlatch' mechanism. We carry specialized tools that can bypass these without shattering the tempered glass or scratching the aluminum frame. We are experts in servicing the unique security needs of Hudson County retail hubs."
  - question: "Do you offer 'Master Key' overrides for property managers?"
    answer: "Yes. If a master key is lost, we can assist in gaining entry to any unit in your building and then perform a master-key rekeying service to invalidate the lost key and restore security to your entire property."
