faqs:
  - question: "Why do standard indoor deadbolts fail on outdoor gates?"
    answer: "Indoor locks are designed for climate-controlled environments. When exposed to NJ's humidity and road salt, internal zinc components oxidize and 'seize.' Furthermore, gates have much larger 'gaps' than doors. We install specialized 'Gate Boxes' or 'Adjustable-Throw' locks that can bridge a 1-2 inch gap and feature weep-holes for moisture drainage."
  - question: "What are the NJ requirements for pool gate locks?"
    answer: "According to the NJ International Residential Code (IRC), pool gates must be self-closing and self-latching. The latch must be located at least 54 inches from the bottom of the gate to prevent small children from reaching it. We carry specialized 'MagnaLatch' and 'TruClose' hardware that is specifically certified for these safety standards."
  - question: "Can I use a smart lock on my backyard fence?"
    answer: "Yes, but it must be an 'IP-Rated' weatherproof model. We recommend the Lockey E-910 or specialized outdoor smart boxes from Yale. These feature rubberized gasketing to prevent water from reaching the electronics and are designed to function in temperatures as low as -30°F."
  - question: "My gate has shifted and the lock no longer matches the hole. Can you fix it?"
    answer: "This is a common issue caused by NJ's freeze-thaw cycle shifting fence posts. We install 'Adjustable Striker' plates that allow for 1-2 inches of vertical and horizontal play. This means your gate can shift slightly as the seasons change without you ever being locked out."
  - question: "Do you install 'Crash Bars' on commercial security gates?"
    answer: "Yes. For apartment complexes or commercial back-access gates, we install outdoor-rated exit devices (panic bars) that allow for emergency egress while maintaining high-security perimeter control."
