faqs:
  - question: "Why do storage facilities require a locksmith for lockouts?"
    answer: "Most storage facilities (like Public Storage or Extra Space) do not keep master keys for tenant units for liability reasons. If you lose your key, you are responsible for hiring a licensed locksmith. We provide the facility with the necessary insurance and licensing documentation to perform the work on their property."
  - question: "Can a circular 'Disc Lock' be picked?"
    answer: "Disc locks are designed specifically to be pick-resistant and difficult to cut with bolt cutters because of their shielded shackle. While some can be picked by a master locksmith, many require a precision 'Lock-Cracking' technique or a specialized drill-out that only affects the core, allowing the door to open without damaging the unit itself."
  - question: "What documents do I need for a storage lockout?"
    answer: "You will need a government-issued photo ID that matches the name on the rental agreement. Most facilities also require you to sign a 'Lock Cut Authorization' form in the presence of the manager. We handle the technical side once the facility has cleared you for entry."
  - question: "My combination lock is jammed. Can you fix it?"
    answer: "Usually, a jammed combination lock is due to internal mechanical failure or rust. While we can attempt to decode or lubricate it, we often recommend a 'Non-Destructive Bypass' to get you inside, followed by a replacement with a high-quality keyed disc lock for better reliability in the future."
  - question: "How long does it take to open a high-security puck lock?"
    answer: "Hidden-shackle 'puck' locks are among the most secure. Opening one usually takes 15-30 minutes of precision work. We use specialized carbide bits and extraction tools to ensure the unit's hasp remains undamaged."
