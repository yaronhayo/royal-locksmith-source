faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between 'Panic Hardware' and 'Fire Exit Hardware'?"
    answer: "This is a critical distinction in NJ building codes. 'Panic Hardware' features a dogging mechanism (allowing the bar to be locked in the retracted position). This cannot be used on fire-rated doors. 'Fire Exit Hardware' is UL-Listed for fire doors and must be 'positive latching' at all times to prevent the door from bowing and allowing the spread of smoke during a fire."
  - question: "Are 'Vertical Rod' exit devices necessary for all double doors?"
    answer: "If your double doors do not have a center post (mullion), then at least one door (usually both) must have vertical rods to secure the door at the top and bottom. We specialize in both surface-mounted and concealed vertical rods (CVR), ensuring that your double doors remain secure against forced entry while providing easy egress."
  - question: "Can we install a panic bar that alerts us when someone uses the back door?"
    answer: "Yes, we frequently install 'Alarmed Exit Devices' (like the Detex Advantex series). These units feature a 100dB+ siren that triggers if the bar is pushed. This is the industry standard for retail stockrooms and back-of-house areas, providing fire-legal egress while preventing internal and external theft."
  - question: "Our panic bar is 'dragging' on the floor. Can it be repaired?"
    answer: "Usually, this is a timing or alignment issue with the vertical rods or a sagging hinge. We are experts in 'Timing' commercial hardware. We'll adjust the top and bottom latches to ensure they retract fully when the bar is pushed, preventing floor drag and ensuring a smooth, compliant operation."
  - question: "What is 'Delayed Egress' hardware?"
    answer: "Delayed egress devices (NFPA 101 compliant) sound an alarm and delay the door from opening for 15 seconds after someone pushes the bar. This is used in healthcare and retail to prevent 'Dash and Grab' theft or wandering patients, while still unlocking automatically if the fire alarm is triggered."
