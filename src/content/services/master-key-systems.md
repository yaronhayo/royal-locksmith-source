faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between a 'Master Key' and a 'Grand Master Key'?"
    answer: "In a hierarchical system, a 'Master Key' typically opens a specific department or section (e.g., all 2nd-floor offices). A 'Grand Master Key' is one level higher, opening every lock in the entire facility across all departments. We can even add a 'Great Grand Master' for multi-building campuses."
  - question: "How safe is a master key system? Can it be easily picked?"
    answer: "A master-keyed lock technically has more shear lines (potential opening points) than a single-keyed lock. However, when designed by a professional, this does not significantly reduce picking resistance. For maximum security, we recommend master-keying high-security cylinders like Medeco or Mul-T-Lock, which are virtually pick-proof regardless of the master pinning."
  - question: "Can you implement a master key system on my existing locks?"
    answer: "If your locks are of the same brand or share a compatible keyway (like Schlage C), we can typically re-pin them into a master system. If your building has a mix of incompatible brands, we may recommend replacing the cylinders with a unified SFIC or high-security system to achieve a single-key solution."
  - question: "What is 'Cross-Keying' and why is it dangerous?"
    answer: "Cross-keying occurs when a lock is pinned to respond to key codes from different branches of the hierarchy that shouldn't match. This 'Ghosting' can happen in amateur systems, where a key intended for Room A accidentally opens Room B. Our precision software-designed charts eliminate these mathematical errors."
  - question: "How do restricted keyways protect my business?"
    answer: "Standard keys can be copied at any automated kiosk or hardware store. Restricted keyways use patent-protected blanks that are only distributed to authorized locksmiths. We hold the registration for your specific key profile, ensuring that only people with your signed authorization can ever obtain a duplicate."
