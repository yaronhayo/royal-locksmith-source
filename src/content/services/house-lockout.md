faqs:
  - question: "Why should I avoid drilling my lock during a lockout?"
    answer: "Drilling is a destructive, final act. It destroys the cylinder and often damages the internal door mechanism. As master technicians, we prioritize 'Picking' or 'Bypassing.' Not only is this cleaner, but it saves you the cost of buying a new lock and having it rekeyed to your existing system."
  - question: "How do you verify ownership if my ID is locked inside?"
    answer: "This is a common scenario. We can verify your identity through digital residents' portals, matching your photo to a social media profile, or by having a neighbor or landlord vouch for you. Once the door is open, we require that you show us your physical ID to finalize the service record."
  - question: "Can a professional locksmith open a high-security lock like Mul-T-Lock?"
    answer: "Most 'run-of-the-mill' locksmiths cannot. However, Royal Locksmith technicians are trained in advanced manipulation techniques. While these locks are designed to be pick-resistant, we have specialized bypass tools that can often grant access without destroying the high-security core."
  - question: "Will your tools scratch my decorative handleset or paint?"
    answer: "No. Unlike amateur methods that use pry bars, we use precision picks made of surgical-grade steel and protected shims. Our tools only interact with the internal mechanical components of the lock, leaving the external finish in pristine condition."
  - question: "Do you provide receipts for insurance reimbursement?"
    answer: "Yes. Many homeowner insurance policies or premium credit cards cover emergency locksmith services. We provide professional, itemized digital receipts that you can submit for reimbursement."
