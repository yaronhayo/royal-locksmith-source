faqs:
  - question: "Why is my car key suddenly not turning in the ignition?"
    answer: "This is usually caused by 'wafer collapse' or metal fatigue. High-security keys (like Honda and Ford) use tiny brass wafers. Over 5-10 years, these wafers wear down or bend, preventing the cylinder from reaching the 'shear line.' If you have to jiggle your key, the ignition is failing. We can rebuild the cylinder with fresh, reinforced wafers on-site."
  - question: "If you replace my ignition, will I need a new set of keys?"
    answer: "No. Unlike a dealership that will simply give you a new ignition with a new key code (meaning your old keys won't open your doors), we perform 'Ignition Re-Pinning.' We disassemble the new cylinder and match its internal configuration to your original key profile. This maintains a 'One Key' system for your vehicle."
  - question: "Can a stuck key in the ignition drain my battery?"
    answer: "Yes. If the key is stuck in the 'ACC' (Accessory) or 'ON' position, your car's electrical systems remain active. If we cannot reach you immediately, we recommend disconnecting the negative battery terminal. We can then extract the key and repair the locking mechanism without any further electrical damage."
  - question: "What is the difference between the ignition 'Cylinder' and the ignition 'Switch'?"
    answer: "The **Cylinder** is the mechanical part where you insert the key. The **Switch** is the electrical component behind it that sends power to the starter. If your key turns but the car doesn't CRANK, it's usually the switch. If the key won't even rotate, it's the cylinder. We carry replacement parts for both."
  - question: "My steering wheel is locked and the key won't turn. Is my ignition broken?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. This is often 'Steering Lock Binding.' If you parked with your wheels turned, the steering column is putting pressure on the ignition bolt. Try turning the steering wheel firmly to the left and right while simultaneously attempting to turn the key. If it still won't budge, the internal locking pin may be seized, requiring our intervention."
