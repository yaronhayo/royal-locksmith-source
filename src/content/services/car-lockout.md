faqs:
  - question: "Will unlocking my car with professional tools damage the air bags?"
    answer: "Absolutely not. Modern vehicles have Side Impact Airbags (SABs) located in the door pillars or seats. Amateur 'slim-jim' methods can trip these sensors or snag wiring. Our NDE (Non-Destructive Entry) methods use the lock cylinder or internal handle, completely bypassing the airbag deployment zones."
  - question: "Why can't I just use a wire hanger like in the movies?"
    answer: "Modern cars (post-1995) have internal shielding around the lock rods specifically to prevent 'coat hanger' entry. Attempting this will likely pull the weather stripping off or, worse, disconnect the lock linkage, turning a simple lockout into an expensive mechanical repair."
  - question: "What is a Lishi tool and why is it better?"
    answer: "A Lishi tool is a precision instrument that we insert into your lock cylinder. It allows us to 'decode' and 'pick' each individual wafer in the lock simultaneously. It is the gold standard for damage-free entry because it never touches your car's body or window seals."
  - question: "I locked my keys in the trunk, and my car has no trunk button. Can you help?"
    answer: "Yes. Many luxury cars disable the interior trunk release when the alarm is active. We use a method called 'Lock Decoding' to read the bitting of the door lock and then use a specialized machine to cut a temporary 'service key' that opens your trunk mechanically."
  - question: "Do you service lockouts in parking garages or major NJ malls?"
    answer: "Yes. We frequently respond to the American Dream Mall, Jersey Gardens, and Willowbrook Mall. Our compact mobile units can enter most low-clearance parking garages to assist you at your vehicle's location."
